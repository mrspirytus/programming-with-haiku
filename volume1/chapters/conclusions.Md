# Where to Go from Here

We have covered an enormous amount of information since Lesson 1. Amazingly, there is still a lot of ground to go if you would like to go beyond being a beginner. The best way to improve is to write code and keep learning as you go. What you know now will give you the ability to write a many different kinds of programs for Haiku and will also give you the tools to learn the rest of the Haiku API and other aspects of programming in C++. Here are some topics that you are encouraged to explore:

## C++

-   Exceptions
-   Templates and the Standard Template Library
-   Multiple Inheritance

## Usability

-   *The Design of Everyday Things*, Donald Norman
-   *The Humane Interface*, Jef Raskin

## Good Programming

-   *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides

## Programming for BeOS / Haiku

-   *Programming the Be Operating System*, Dan Parks Sydow. This is out-of-print but is available from O'Reilly's website as a free PDF.
-   The BeOS sample code projects and accompanying articles
-   *The Be Book*. This is the authoritative manual on the BeOS / Haiku API.
